This is an iOS app that plays white, pink, and brown noise.

Most white noise apps lack features that I would like to have, so I made my own. Those features are:
* Sleep timer
* Wavy volume
* Fading volume
* Control Center/bluetooth/lock-screen controls

Additionally most of the existing apps are ugly/outdated, so I'm attempting to use a simple design.

The app store page is [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/white-noise-plus/id1281372285?mt=8).

There is a nearly identical Android version [here](https://github.com/davidalbers/whitenoise).
